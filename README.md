ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shahaf Meron.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a passionate Web Developer with a strong focus on React and front-end development.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in Web Fundamentals and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

ðŸ”§ As a webmaster, I manage websites, ensuring optimal performance and user experience. I have extensive experience with React, building dynamic and responsive web applications.

ðŸ’¼ One of my key projects is a lead generation questionnaire app built with React. This project showcases my ability to create interactive interfaces, handle dynamic forms, and integrate with REST APIs. My skills include JavaScript, React, HTML5, and CSS3, along with knowledge of server-side methodologies like REST API and AWS services.
